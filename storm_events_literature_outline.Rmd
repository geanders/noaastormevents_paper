# Outline of Concerns with Database  

## Episodes  

- one episode in NOAA storm events correlates to mulitple events [@konisky2016extreme]

- limited information on event severity or distinction between events [@luh2015vulnerability]  
    
## Units of Aggregation  

- smallest unit of aggregation to use all parts of database are Weather Forecasting Offices and there are about 122 nationwide [@konisky2016extreme]
    
## Inaccurate Reporting  
- supply of information is greater in areas closer to weather event [@konisky2016extreme] 

- information not verified by National Weather Service [@luh2015vulnerability] 
leads to underreporting, over reporting, inaccurate reporting  

    + reporting affected by geographic location [@luh2015vulnerability]
