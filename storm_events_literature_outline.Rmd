# Concerns with Storm Events Database  

## Hazard Bias   

* P(event recorded | event happened) may be different by events  

* There can be inaccurate recording of the frequency of certain hazards types within the database  

* This is influenced by the goal or audience of the database  

    - For example, the US is esepcially concerned with monetary losses from floods so it may be more likely for flood events to be reported [@gall2009losses]  
    
         *script to pull up number of floods compared to other events in noaa  
 
* This also arises from the difficulty of sorting storm events that include multiple types of hazards  

    - Definitional differences [@gall2009losses]
    
    - one episode can correlates to mulitple events [@konisky2016extreme]  
    
        *script for how noaa deals with this? or examples of this?  
        
* limited information on event severity or distinction between events [@luh2015vulnerability]  

* interrupted time series analysis: change in flood policy since 1996  

    - years of big policy changes for floods (flood insurance) 


## Temporal Bias    

* There can be changes in the number of storm events and loss estimates reported over time [@gall2009losses]  

    - Advancements in monitoring and detecting: sometimes descriptions include equipment used 
    
    - Better loss accounting  
    
    - New process for loss estimation developed by NWS in 2007  
    
    - Switch between categorical estimates to whole dollar figure estimates: uses logarithmic at some point?    
    
         * pull up loss data for events pre and post 1995  
         
    - check for changes in reporting for NOAA under Database Details  
        
        * from 1950 to 1954, only tornado events were recorded (NOAA-how should I cite this?)  
        * from 1955 to 1992, only tornado, thunderstorm wind and hail events were keyed from the paper publications into digital data. From 1993 to 1995, only tornado, thunderstorm wind and hail events have been extracted from the Unformatted Text Files  
        * From 1996 to present, 48 event types are recorded
         
* Seasonal Differences in number of events reported 

    - Example of rip currents in summer vs winter  
    
        * run for our data and check literature for seasonality of the weather event  
        
        * create table of number reported by lifeguards or media vs month of the year  
        
    - other events that are more or less reported?   
    

## Threshold Bias  

* Events of larger maginutude and/or damage to human health are better documented [@gall2009losses]   

* Events of smaller magnitude are less reported becasue less people are affected [@gall2009losses]   

    - may even be excluded due to threshold criteria [@gall2009losses]   

## Accounting Bias 

* Discrepencies in type of loss information collected [@gall2009losses] 

    - Direct monetary losses from damage to infrastructure, buildings, crops, etc. are easier to quanitfy than indirect losses like lost revenue, business closures, societal losses, environmental damage [@gall2009losses]  
    
        * how does noaa report different types of losses? 
    
* Can count economic losses at community, state, regional, global level [@gall2009losses]  

     - what level does noaa report this at? 
      
* How can nonmonetary losses be quanitifed? 

## Geographic Bias  

* Reporting affected by geographic location [@luh2015vulnerability]  

    - differences between rural/urban  
    
        * tornado example

    - There can be changes at country or state level over time that lead to excluding or double counting events or loss data [@gall2009losses]  
    
    - NWS changed its reporting strategy from loss estimates by climate region to loss estimates in specific counties where event occurred (relevant for data in 1995 during switch) [@gall2009losses]  
    
        * script for checking event location pre and post 1995 
    
* Supply of information is greater in areas closer to weather event [@konisky2016extreme] 

* Smallest unit of aggregation to use all parts of database are Weather Forecasting Offices and there are about 122 nationwide [@konisky2016extreme]  

    - zone and fips script  
        
## Systemic Bias    

* Differences in initial data collection and compilation create difficulties in comparing databases  

    - Source and how losses are computed  
    
    - Actual dollar losses vs inflation adjusted losses    
    
    - Whole dollars vs loss categories
