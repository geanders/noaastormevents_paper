# Concerns with Storm Events Database  

## Hazard Bias   

* There can be inaccurate recording of the frequency of certain hazards types within the database  

* This is influenced by the goal or audience of the database  

    - For example, the US is esepcially concerned with monetary losses from floods so it may be more likely for flood events to be reported [@gall2009losses]  
    
         *script to pull up number of floods compared to other events in noaa  
 
* This also arises from the difficulty of sorting storm events that include multiple types of hazards  

    - Definitional differences [@gall2009losses]
    
    - one episode can correlates to mulitple events [@konisky2016extreme]  
    
        *script for how noaa deals with this? or examples of this?  
        
* limited information on event severity or distinction between events [@luh2015vulnerability]  


## Temporal Bias    

* There can be changes in the number of storm events and loss estimates reported over time [@gall2009losses]  

    - Advancements in monitoring and detecting  
    
    - Better loss accounting  
    
    - New process for loss estimation developed by NWS in 2007  
    
    - Switch between categorical estimates to whole dollar figure estimates  
    
         * pull up loss data for events pre and post 1995 

## Threshold Bias  

* Events of larger maginutude and/or damage to human health are better documented [@gall2009losses]   

* Events of smaller magnitude are less reported becasue less people are affected [@gall2009losses]   

    - may even be excluded due to threshold criteria [@gall2009losses]   

## Accounting Bias 

* Discrepencies in type of loss information collected [@gall2009losses] 

    - Direct monetary losses from damage to infrastructure, buildings, crops, etc. are easier to quanitfy than indirect losses like lost revenue, business closures, societal losses, environmental damage [@gall2009losses]  
    
        * how does noaa report different types of losses? 
    
* Can count economic losses at community, state, regional, global level [@gall2009losses]  

     - what level does noaa report this at? 
      
* How can nonmonetary losses be quanitifed? 

## Geographic Bias  

* Reporting affected by geographic location [@luh2015vulnerability]  

    - There can be changes at country or state level over time that lead to excluding or double counting events or loss data [@gall2009losses]  
    
    - NWS changed its reporting strategy from loss estimates by climate region to loss estimates in specific counties where event occurred (relevant for data in 1995 during switch) [@gall2009losses]  
    
        * script for checking event location pre and post 1995 
    
* Supply of information is greater in areas closer to weather event [@konisky2016extreme] 

* Smallest unit of aggregation to use all parts of database are Weather Forecasting Offices and there are about 122 nationwide [@konisky2016extreme]  

    - zone and fips script  
        
## Systemic Bias    

* Differences in initial data collection and compilation create difficulties in comparing databases  

    - Source and how losses are computed  
    
    - Actual dollar losses vs inflation adjusted losses    
    
    - Whole dollars vs loss categories
