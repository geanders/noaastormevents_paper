# Day 2 
### Summarize your manuscript 

The Storm Events database collects information from the National Weather Service regarding weather events that occur in the United States. Many researchers use this database to conduct studies on how weather events impact human life, property and crop damage, and commerce. Though the database is quite extensive, several concerns and biases may be present in its data. 


It is important to understand these biases so that studies using this dataset can accurately portray trends and changes caused by weather events. 

### Identify key Introduction components in an example paper
Twitter: 

1. What is the larger problem that the paper will be tackling?
    - Arguing for the use of twitter in the science community 
2. What is the relevant context for that problem?
    - The increasing popularity of social media (twitter in particular-320 mil active users) and the potential for the use of twitter to increase collaboration and spread information 
3. What are the key characters?
    - Twitter and its users, researchers, the science community in general  
4. What background information is given to help the reader understand the specific work in the paper?
    - It describes what twitter is and how it is used in general and in the science community
    - It gives some background on the authors of the paper
5. What is the “challenge” (“the specific hypotheses/questions/goals of the current work”)?
    - educating researchers on how to use twitter to their benefit within science 

Shwartz Ecological Fallacy: 

1. What is the larger problem that the paper will be tackling?
    - defining and examining ecological fallacy as a general validity probblem 

2. What is the relevant context for that problem?
    - epidemiology's wide use of ecological studies 
    - epidemiology's use of ecological fallacy to describe the flaws in their studies 

3. What are the key characters?
    - epidemiology, epidemiologists, Robinson, the use of ecological fallacy as a concept 

4. What background information is given to help the reader understand the specific work in the paper?
    - epidemiology's use of ecological studies 
    - previous research and papers that have tried to define ecological fallacy
    - examples of previous consequneces of ecological fallacy 

    
5. What is the “challenge” (“the specific hypotheses/questions/goals of the current work”)? 
    - redefining ecological fallacy as a general validity issue 
    - showing how this new definition will dissect ecological fallacy into three distinct fallacy notions   

### Diagnose the Opening for an example paper 

Shwartz Ecological Fallacy:
Who do you think is the intended audience for the paper? What is the larger issue the paper will address? Do you think that they are properly “advertising” what they will later cover in the paper?  

I think that this article is trying to target epidemiologists and other researchers that use population data or are interested in this field of science. The first paragraph brings up epidemiology, ecological studies, and ecological fallacy. This leads the reader to believe that the paper will be about these topics, but it is unclear that the rest of the paper will be about redefining ecological fallacy. 

### Define Opening components for your paper.

What is the target audience? Is it broad / interdisciplinary or targeted to researchers in a certain field?
What is the larger issue that the manuscript will address? In writing this, be sure to be clear about the scope with which the manuscript will cover this issue.
What are a few elements of the issue that are interesting but that your manuscript will not address?

My manuscript is attempting to target scientists using the NOAA storm events database for research. It is broad in terms of how it discusses general bias in data, but specific in that it focuses on the NOAA database and its weather data. My manuscript covers what the NOAA Storm Events database is, examples of how it has been used in research, and 4-5 biases that occur in the dataset. Though my writing will cover 4-5 broad biases and include some examples of each type, there are several other examples that could also showcase the biases. There may also be other forms of bias in the data that I do not cover. 


### Revise the Opening for your manuscript.
Does your Opening need the whole paragraph, or just the first sentence or two? Does this first paragraph include any signals to clarify what audience you expect for the manuscript? Does the paragraph give readers clues on the larger issue that the manuscript will address? Does the paragraph “overpromise”, indicating that the manuscript will cover a larger scope than it does?
